# Base2Tone Dark Sea Syntax

Based on Base2Tone [Sea colorscheme](https://base2t.one/demo/sea/), which in turn is inspired by Simurai's [DuoTone themes](http://simurai.com/projects/2016/01/01/duotone-themes) and utilizes [Base16 Builder](https://github.com/base16-builder/base16-builder) to produce output theme.
